# Why this topic matters

>if you are learning something and working with it ,you need to understand the purpose of why are you choosing it over others,the best use case for it.

## What type of database is the best fit for the complex query intensive environment?

### SQL

## What type of database is the best fit for hierarchical data storage?

### NOSQL

## Describe the differences in scalability between a SQl and NoSQL database as though you were speaking to a non-technical friend.

>SQL databases are much resource intensive than nosql,cause in nosql you are searching in a an object based database which wont cost a lot of resources ,in sql its a alot of tables connected together and sometimes you need to search in multple tables to find the coulmn that you need,** so if you want to sacale up a sql based app you need to get more resources and more power ,in nosql you need to get more resources and devide the work between them.

## Among data tables, what is a one-to-many relationship and how do we “relate” them?

### one to many is when a on table have realshins to  many tables ,like one user has multiple comments thats one to many

## Prior to designing your relational database, it might be useful to draw a digram of  the database tables and their relationships

## Explain the difference between a primary and foreign key

> the primary key is a unique key that identify each row in the table ,each table normally has one primary key,foreign key is a match for the primary key in another table.

## How do we treat keywords and parameters differently in SQL syntax?

>there is a set of predefined queries in sql that are meant to execute a command ,rather than nosql its a set of methods built in .

## Define normalization within the context of schemas and data

>we use normalization in schemas to avoide storing duplicated data and then the database becomes inconsistant

## Explain the difference between one-to-one, one-to-many, and many-to-many relationships to a non-technical recruiter

>asumme you have a user,user info ,user comments,user role, a relation between the user and its info is one-to-one,a relation between the user and its comments is one-to-many,a relation between the user and its role is many-to-many.

## Things I want to know more about

> normalizing isn't very clear in my head yet, what i want to know is how is it used in real life.
