## Stacks

To help you understand stacks ,think about it like a book shelf ,when you put a book at the end it will be the first book you take out if you want to empty that  shelf.

stacks follows a concept called LIFO , which means Last in first out ,it has a top which is the first element at the top or the last element you inserted ,

each node in the stack points to the next element ,so the top will point to the next to it which is the book under it .

 

## Queues

queues on the other hand follows a concept called FIFO, which means first in first out.

queues have a front element and a rear element the front is the firs item that got enqued to the queue and the rear is the last element
