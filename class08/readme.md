>Three primary rules are defined for RBAC:
1- Role assignment: A subject can exercise a permission only if the subject has selected or been assigned a role.

2- Role authorization: A subject’s active role must be authorized for the subject. With rule 1 above, this rule ensures that users can take on only roles for which they are authorized.

3- Permission authorization: A subject can exercise a permission only if the permission is authorized for the subject’s active role. With rules 1 and 2, this rule ensures that users can exercise only permissions for which they are authorized.
