## The growth Mindset 

### this is a very important statment because  you are going to face alot of struggles throughout your career and if you dont have the best mindset to deal with it you are going to suffer emotionally and mentally .

> from what i understood and what i learned in my life and prevous work experience ,**don't make motivation the main driver for your work or studies**,cause simply most of the times you won't be ,and if you dont force your self to work ,lean more ,get Up and improve 
> you will not successed in your career .

### BUT

> that doesn't mean you only have to choose things you hate and do them ,**UNLESS YOU HAVE TO **, but instead choose things you love to do,things that are helpfull to your self ,your society ,your family ,if you did you will save your self alot of pain in the long term.
