## why this topic matters as it relates to what you are studying in this module.
>understanding data structure and algorithms is  nesessary for a programer ,it alows him to create efficient and scalable functionalite,it also alows him to have great problem sovling skills which will help alot in his career

## What is 1 of the more important things you should consider when deciding which data structure is best suited to solve a particular problem?
>to determine the best data structure to use you need to analyze your problem  carefully and know which operations will be made by this algorithm,some data structures  arent very effiecient at searching or sorting so you need to avoide these data structures .

## How can we ensure that weâ€™ll avoid an infinite recursive call stack?

> to avoide inifite loops you need to determine a base case which the recursive call will stop at .

## Things I want to know more about

#### i want to understand recursion clearly and be good at analayzing the problem .
